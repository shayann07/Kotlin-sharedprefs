# Kotlin SharedPrefs

This is a simple Android sample application that demonstrates how to persist small amounts of data using **SharedPreferences** in Kotlin. The project shows how to serialize and deserialize a data class to store user settings or other key–value pairs in a type-safe way.

## Features

- Illustrates how to define a Kotlin data class to represent your preferences.
- Shows how to write extension functions to save and retrieve the data class to and from SharedPreferences.
- Provides a basic UI for entering and updating preference values.
- Demonstrates reading the stored preferences when the app starts.

## Getting started

1. **Clone the repository** and open the project in Android Studio.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shayann07/Kotlin-sharedprefs.git
   cd Kotlin-sharedprefs
   ```

2. **Sync and build**

   Android Studio should automatically download the necessary Gradle dependencies. Once synced, you can build and run the app on an emulator or physical device.

3. **Try it out**

   Enter some values in the provided fields and save them. Relaunch the app to verify that your preferences are persisted using SharedPreferences.

## Technologies used

- **Kotlin** – concise and modern language for Android development.
- **Android SDK** – app development framework.
- **SharedPreferences** – Android API for saving simple key-value data.
- **Jetpack libraries** – such as AppCompat for UI components.
